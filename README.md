# CGFinal
 
Color Grading - Added a warm and low brightness feature. This was implemented because I thought it was unique.
Hologram added on the player as i think it enhances the look of the player
Lambert shder added to the enemy as i think it showcases the ambient shader very well
Toon shader added to the block in the sky as I think the blocks fit the cartoon theme of the shader and the game overall has a cartoony graphical style.
